# Demo scenario
demo_scenario:
  title: "Pre-Delivery Quality Inspection"
  description: |
    A newly manufactured vehicle undergoes final quality inspection before customer delivery.
    
    The solution will:
    1. Verify all required parts are installed
    2. Perform 12-point quality inspection (paint, panels, engine, etc.)
    3. Identify and categorize any defects
    4. Make approve/reject decision based on quality threshold
    5. Generate detailed inspection report with recommendations
    6. Learn from inspection patterns to improve future checks
    
    **Why Normal Mode?**
    - LLM understands complex defect patterns and root causes
    - Intelligent categorization of defect severity
    - Context-aware recommendations for remediation
    - Learns from previous inspections to improve accuracy
    - Natural language inspection reports for technicians
    
  sample_input:
    vehicle_vin: "1HGBH41JXMN109186"
    inspection_type: "pre_delivery"
    quality_threshold: 85
    checklist: "Body paint quality, Panel alignment, Door operation, Window operation, Engine start, Transmission shift, Brake function, Suspension check, Lights operation, Interior finish, Instrument cluster, Climate control"

# Performance expectations (Normal Mode)
performance:
  llm_calls_per_inspection: "6-10 calls"
  inspection_time: "3-5 seconds"
  cost_per_inspection: "~$0.10"
  quality_score: "98% (Very high accuracy)"
