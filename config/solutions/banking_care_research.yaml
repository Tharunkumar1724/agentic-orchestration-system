# Demo scenario
demo_scenario:
  title: "High-Volume Fraud Detection at Scale"
  description: |
    A bank processes 10,000+ transactions daily and needs real-time fraud detection.
    
    The solution will:
    1. Chunk historical fraud cases into 200-word segments
    2. Create TF-IDF vectors for fraud pattern recognition
    3. Match incoming transactions against known patterns
    4. Provide agents with top 3 similar fraud cases (200 bytes vs 50 KB)
    5. Make instant decisions (<100ms)
    6. Process thousands of transactions with zero LLM costs
    
    **Why Research Mode?**
    - Zero cost for transaction pattern matching
    - Instant fraud detection (<100ms)
    - Scales to millions of transactions
    - Pattern-based detection sufficient for most fraud
    - Perfect for automated tier-1 screening

# Client presentation talking points
presentation_points:
  - "**Zero Cost at Scale**: Process unlimited transactions with no LLM charges"
  - "**Real-Time Detection**: <100ms fraud detection for instant decisions"
  - "**Enterprise Scale**: Handle millions of transactions daily"
  - "**Pattern Recognition**: TF-IDF vectors match fraud signatures efficiently"
  - "**Cost Example**: $288K annual savings vs Normal mode for high-volume bank"
  - "**Smart Chunking**: Transaction data chunked for optimal pattern matching"

# Hybrid deployment strategy
hybrid_approach:
  tier_1_research: "Use Research mode for automated screening (80% of cases)"
  tier_2_normal: "Use Normal mode for complex cases requiring reasoning (20%)"
  cost_optimization: "Combine both for optimal cost/quality balance"
  blended_savings: "~$230K annual savings with hybrid approach"

# Integration points
integrations:
  - "Real-time transaction streams"
  - "Fraud pattern databases"
  - "Account management systems"
  - "Automated decisioning engines"
  - "Alert and notification systems"
