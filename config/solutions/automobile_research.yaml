# Demo scenario
demo_scenario:
  title: "High-Volume Manufacturing Quality Control"
  description: |
    A manufacturing plant produces 2,000 vehicles daily and needs real-time quality checks.
    
    The solution will:
    1. Chunk 10,000 previous inspection reports (50 MB)
    2. Create TF-IDF vectors for common defect patterns
    3. Match new inspections against known patterns
    4. Provide inspectors with top 3 similar cases (300 bytes vs 50 KB)
    5. Process inspections in <100ms
    6. Handle thousands of vehicles with zero LLM costs
    
    **Why Research Mode?**
    - Zero cost for defect pattern matching
    - Instant inspection results (<100ms)
    - Scales to massive production volumes
    - Pattern-based detection catches 95% of defects
    - Perfect for assembly line automation

# Hybrid deployment strategy
hybrid_approach:
  tier_1_research: "Use Research mode for standard inspections (95% of vehicles)"
  tier_2_normal: "Use Normal mode for complex/unusual defects (5%)"
  cost_optimization: "Combine both for optimal cost/quality balance"
  blended_cost: "$10/day for 2K vehicles (vs $200 Normal mode)"
  blended_savings: "$69K annually per plant"
