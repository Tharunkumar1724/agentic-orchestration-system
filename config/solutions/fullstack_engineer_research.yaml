# Demo scenario
demo_scenario:
  title: "High-Volume Code Review at Scale"
  description: |
    A team processes 100+ pull requests daily with:
    - Multiple microservices
    - Shared libraries
    - Common patterns
    
    The solution will:
    1. Chunk code into 200-word segments
    2. Create TF-IDF vectors for pattern matching
    3. Retrieve relevant code patterns via similarity search
    4. Provide agents with only relevant context (96% data reduction)
    5. Process workflows 30x faster than Normal mode
    
    **Why Research Mode?**
    - Zero LLM costs for code storage/retrieval
    - Blazing fast processing (<100ms)
    - Scales to massive codebases
    - Pattern matching sufficient for common issues
    - Perfect for CI/CD automation

      # Same FastAPI code as Normal mode
      from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
      from pydantic import BaseModel
      
      app = FastAPI()
      users_db = {}
      
      class User(BaseModel):
          id: int
          name: str
          email: str

              raise HTTPException(400, "User exists")
          users_db[user.id] = user
          return {"status": "created", "user": user}
