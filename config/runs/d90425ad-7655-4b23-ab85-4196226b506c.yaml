      **Definition and Classification**


      According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various species
      of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked
      than swans and geese, and they are typically found in or near water bodies.
      This classification includes over 120 different species of ducks.


      **Rubber Duck Debugging**


      The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
      is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
      representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program or a
      web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly and approachable
      interface for users to report problems or issues with a product or service.

          has multiple meanings and applications. Here''s a comprehensive overview:


          **Definition and Classification**


          According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various
          species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
          and shorter-necked than swans and geese, and they are typically found in
          or near water bodies. This classification includes over 120 different species
          of ducks.


          **Rubber Duck Debugging**


          The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
          is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
          representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program
          or a web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly
          and approachable interface for users to report problems or issues with a
          product or service.


          **Conservation and Habitat Protection**


          The third search result leads to the website of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit
          organization dedicated to conserving and protecting wetlands, grasslands,
          and associated habitats. This organization was established in 1937 and focuses
          on benefiting waterfowl and other wildlife species. Their efforts include
          habitat restoration, research, and advocacy for environmental conservation.


          In summary, the term "duck" has multiple meanings and applications, including:


          1. A common name for various species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.

          2. A figurative representation of a friendly helper in computer programming
          or web development (rubber duck debugging).

          3. A reference to a nonprofit organization that conserves and protects habitats
          to benefit waterfowl and other wildlife species (Ducks Unlimited).'

        llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the term "duck"
          has multiple meanings and applications. Here''s a comprehensive overview:


          **Definition and Classification**


          According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various
          species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
          and shorter-necked than swans and geese, and they are typically found in
          or near water bodies. This classification includes over 120 different species
          of ducks.


          **Rubber Duck Debugging**


          The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
          is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
          representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program
          or a web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly
          and approachable interface for users to report problems or issues with a
          product or service.

        llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the term "duck"
          has multiple meanings and applications. Here''s a comprehensive overview:


          **Definition and Classification**


          According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various
          species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
          and shorter-necked than swans and geese, and they are typically found in
          or near water bodies. This classification includes over 120 different species
          of ducks.


          **Rubber Duck Debugging**


          The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
          is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
          representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program
          or a web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly
          and approachable interface for users to report problems or issues with a
          product or service.


          **Conservation and Habitat Protection**


          The third search result leads to the website of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit
          organization dedicated to conserving and protecting wetlands, grasslands,
          and associated habitats. This organization was established in 1937 and focuses
          on benefiting waterfowl and other wildlife species. Their efforts include

        llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the term "duck"
          has multiple meanings and applications. Here''s a comprehensive overview:


          **Definition and Classification**


          According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various
          species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
          and shorter-necked than swans and geese, and they are typically found in
          or near water bodies. This classification includes over 120 different species
          of ducks.


          **Rubber Duck Debugging**


          The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
          is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
          representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program
          or a web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly
          and approachable interface for users to report problems or issues with a
          product or service.


          **Conservation and Habitat Protection**


          The third search result leads to the website of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit
          organization dedicated to conserving and protecting wetlands, grasslands,
          and associated habitats. This organization was established in 1937 and focuses
          on benefiting waterfowl and other wildlife species. Their efforts include
          habitat restoration, research, and advocacy for environmental conservation.


          In summary, the term "duck" has multiple meanings and applications, including:


          1. A common name for various species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.

          2. A figurative representation of a friendly helper in computer programming
          or web development (rubber duck debugging).

          3. A reference to a nonprofit organization that conserves and protects habitats
          to benefit waterfowl and other wildlife species (Ducks Unlimited).'

        llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the term "duck"
          has multiple meanings and applications. Here''s a comprehensive overview:


          **Definition and Classification**


          According to the Wikipedia article on "Duck," this term refers to various
          species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
          and shorter-necked than swans and geese, and they are typically found in
          or near water bodies. This classification includes over 120 different species
          of ducks.


          **Rubber Duck Debugging**


          The Wikipedia article also mentions "rubber duck debugging," a concept that
          is unrelated to the bird itself. In this context, a "rubber duck" is a figurative
          representation of a fictional helper that appears in a computer program
          or a web browser. The idea behind this concept is to provide a friendly
          and approachable interface for users to report problems or issues with a
          product or service.


          **Conservation and Habitat Protection**


          The third search result leads to the website of Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit
          organization dedicated to conserving and protecting wetlands, grasslands,
          and associated habitats. This organization was established in 1937 and focuses
          on benefiting waterfowl and other wildlife species. Their efforts include
          habitat restoration, research, and advocacy for environmental conservation.


          In summary, the term "duck" has multiple meanings and applications, including:


          1. A common name for various species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.

          2. A figurative representation of a friendly helper in computer programming
          or web development (rubber duck debugging).

          3. A reference to a nonprofit organization that conserves and protects habitats
          to benefit waterfowl and other wildlife species (Ducks Unlimited).'
