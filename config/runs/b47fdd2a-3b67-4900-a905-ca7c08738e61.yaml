      workflow" might not be visible in Microsoft Teams, and instead, you can manually
      run a workflow using specific commands or tools. Here are the steps to run a
      workflow based on the search results:


      **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions**


      1. If you have created a workflow on a non-default branch (e.g., a feature branch),
      you can use the `--ref` flag to run the workflow on that branch. For example:

      ```

      gh workflow run --ref <branch-name> <workflow-name>

      ```

      Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to run the workflow
      on, and `<workflow-name>` with the name of the workflow you want to run.


      2. If you want to list valid workflow names, use the `gh workflow` command with
      the `list` option:

      ```

      gh workflow list

      ```

      **Option 2: Using GitHub CLI**


      1. To run a workflow, use the `workflow run` subcommand. Replace `<workflow-parameter>`
      with the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to run:

      ```

      gh workflow run <workflow-parameter>

      ```

      **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface**


      1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you created
      the workflow.

      2. Click on the "Actions" tab.

      3. Find the workflow you want to run and click on the three dots next to it.

      4. Select "Run workflow" from the dropdown menu.


      **Option 4: Using Power Apps or Power Automate**


      1. If you created the workflow using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow),
      you can run it from within Power Apps or Power Automate.

      2. Open Power Apps or Power Automate and navigate to the workflow you want to
      run.

      3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the workflow.


      **Additional Tips**


      * Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the workflow.

      * Check the security constraints defined by your organization to ensure you
      can complete the steps.

      * For troubleshooting information, see the GitHub Docs or the Microsoft documentation
      for Power Apps and Power Automate.'

            \ 2023 \xB7 I just figured out, if you try to create manual workflow from\
            \ any branches other than master/main, it won't show workflow in left\
            \ panel nor it will show \" Run workflow \" button to trigger. Aug 11,\
            \ 2020 \xB7 To run a workflow on a branch other than the repository's\
            \ default branch, use the --ref flag. To list valid workflow names, use\
            \ gh workflow list. To add input parameters, run it like this: Sign up\
            \ to request clarification or add additional context in comments. See\
            \ more on stackoverflow Jul 12, 2024 \xB7 Workflows automate business\
            \ processes without a user interface. People usually use workflow processes\
            \ to initiate automation that doesn\u2019t require any user interaction.\
            \ How do I run a workflow? To see the Run workflow button, your workflow\
            \ file must use the workflow_dispatch event trigger. Only workflow files\
            \ that use the workflow_dispatch event trigger will have the option to\
            \ run the workflow manually using the Run workflow button. For more information\
            \ about configuring the workflow_dispatch event, see Events that trigger\
            \ workflows. Does a workflow run automatically? Your workflow will run\
            \ automatically . An \"automatic\" requires no further action from you\
            \ once you've added it. Each workflow has a trigger, and when the trigger\
            \ occurs, an action or series of actions happen automatically. Here are\
            \ two examples: A Planner task on a board (specified when you set up the\
            \ workflow) changes status. Why do people use workflow processes? People\
            \ usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn\u2019\
            t require any user interaction . There are two types of workflows: Background\
            \ workflows. Background workflows run when the system has resource availability\
            \ (asynchronously). Go to the Power Automate documentation for more details\
            \ about background workflows. Real-time workflows. How do I run a workflow\
            \ on a Github Branch? You can run a workflow that is still in development\
            \ in a branch branch-name from the command line, with the GitHub CLI.\
            \ The documentation says: To run a workflow on a branch other than the\
            \ repository's default branch, use the --ref flag . To list valid workflow\
            \ names, use gh workflow list. To add input parameters, run it like this:\
            \ Does workflow_dispatch work if a workflow has been run once? Specifically\
            \ for workflow_dispatch this won't work until the workflow has run once\
            \ before. You can add a push event hook and then it will be activated\
            \ after running once. Using gh workflow list you can see the job in the\
            \ list once it has run once. Hmm I didn't know that gh exists. Thanks.\
            \ Sadly as @Dustin wrote. How do I run a workflow on a different branch?\
            \ To run a workflow on a branch other than the repository's default branch,\
            \ use the --ref flag . To view the progress of the workflow run, use the\
            \ run watch subcommand and select the run from the interactive list. When\
            \ using the REST API, you configure the inputs and ref as request body\
            \ parameters. This section will cover the various ways in which you can\
            \ run a flow in Power Automate . From manually triggering it to setting\
            \ up automatic executions, we will explore the different options available\
            \ to make your workflows more efficient."

    llm_response: '**Research Agent''s Analysis**


      Based on the web search results, I have identified the key features and use
      cases of case studies, which are a crucial component of research methodology.


      **Key Features of Case Studies:**


      1. **Clear Objective**: A well-defined research question or objective is essential
      for conducting a case study. This objective should be specific, measurable,
      achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

      2. **Data Requirements**: Case studies require a comprehensive collection of
      data, including both qualitative and quantitative information. This data should
      be relevant to the research objective and support analysis.

      3. **Stakeholders**: Identifying the stakeholders involved in data collection
      and decision-making is critical. This includes individuals or organizations
      that have a vested interest in the research findings.

      4. **Relevant Data**: Selecting data that is relevant to the research question
      and objective is essential. This involves identifying the most critical variables
      and indicators that will support analysis.

      5. **Methodology**: Case studies involve a structured approach, including data
      collection, analysis, and interpretation. This may involve multiple methods,
      such as interviews, observations, and document analysis.


      **Use Cases of Case Studies:**


      1. **Exploratory Research**: Case studies are often used to explore a new topic
      or research question. This involves collecting data and analyzing it to gain
      a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.

      2. **In-Depth Analysis**: Case studies provide a comprehensive and in-depth
      analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. This involves collecting
      and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

      3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
      This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
      that support or challenge existing theory.

      4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices or
      successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

      5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a particular program, policy, or intervention.


      **Conclusion**


      Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth and
      comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
      the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and conduct
      effective studies that support their research objectives.


      **Recommendations**


      1. Clearly define the research objective and scope of the case study.

      2. Identify the relevant stakeholders and data requirements.

      3. Select data that is relevant to the research question and objective.

      4. Use a structured approach to data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

      5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the case study methodology and adjust as needed.

      llm_response: '**Research Agent''s Analysis**


        Based on the web search results, I have identified the key features and use
        cases of case studies, which are a crucial component of research methodology.


        **Key Features of Case Studies:**


        1. **Clear Objective**: A well-defined research question or objective is essential
        for conducting a case study. This objective should be specific, measurable,
        achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

        2. **Data Requirements**: Case studies require a comprehensive collection
        of data, including both qualitative and quantitative information. This data
        should be relevant to the research objective and support analysis.

        3. **Stakeholders**: Identifying the stakeholders involved in data collection
        and decision-making is critical. This includes individuals or organizations
        that have a vested interest in the research findings.

        4. **Relevant Data**: Selecting data that is relevant to the research question
        and objective is essential. This involves identifying the most critical variables
        and indicators that will support analysis.

        5. **Methodology**: Case studies involve a structured approach, including
        data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This may involve multiple methods,
        such as interviews, observations, and document analysis.


        **Use Cases of Case Studies:**


        1. **Exploratory Research**: Case studies are often used to explore a new
        topic or research question. This involves collecting data and analyzing it
        to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.

        2. **In-Depth Analysis**: Case studies provide a comprehensive and in-depth
        analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. This involves collecting
        and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

        3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
        This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
        that support or challenge existing theory.

        4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices
        or successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

        5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
        of a particular program, policy, or intervention.


        **Conclusion**


        Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth
        and comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
        the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and
        conduct effective studies that support their research objectives.


        **Recommendations**


        1. Clearly define the research objective and scope of the case study.

        2. Identify the relevant stakeholders and data requirements.

        3. Select data that is relevant to the research question and objective.

        4. Use a structured approach to data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the case study methodology and adjust as
        needed.

      llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the button "Run
        workflow" might not be visible in Microsoft Teams, and instead, you can manually
        run a workflow using specific commands or tools. Here are the steps to run
        a workflow based on the search results:


        **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions**


        1. If you have created a workflow on a non-default branch (e.g., a feature
        branch), you can use the `--ref` flag to run the workflow on that branch.
        For example:

        ```

        gh workflow run --ref <branch-name> <workflow-name>

        ```

        Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to run the workflow
        on, and `<workflow-name>` with the name of the workflow you want to run.


        2. If you want to list valid workflow names, use the `gh workflow` command
        with the `list` option:

        ```

        gh workflow list

        ```

        **Option 2: Using GitHub CLI**


        1. To run a workflow, use the `workflow run` subcommand. Replace `<workflow-parameter>`
        with the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to run:

        ```

        gh workflow run <workflow-parameter>

        ```

        **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface**


        1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you
        created the workflow.

        2. Click on the "Actions" tab.

        3. Find the workflow you want to run and click on the three dots next to it.

        4. Select "Run workflow" from the dropdown menu.


        **Option 4: Using Power Apps or Power Automate**


        1. If you created the workflow using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow),
        you can run it from within Power Apps or Power Automate.

        2. Open Power Apps or Power Automate and navigate to the workflow you want
        to run.

        3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the workflow.


        **Additional Tips**


        * Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the workflow.

        * Check the security constraints defined by your organization to ensure you
        can complete the steps.

        * For troubleshooting information, see the GitHub Docs or the Microsoft documentation
        for Power Apps and Power Automate.'

      llm_response: '**Research Agent''s Analysis**


        Based on the web search results, I have identified the key features and use
        cases of case studies, which are a crucial component of research methodology.


        **Key Features of Case Studies:**


        1. **Clear Objective**: A well-defined research question or objective is essential
        for conducting a case study. This objective should be specific, measurable,
        achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

        2. **Data Requirements**: Case studies require a comprehensive collection
        of data, including both qualitative and quantitative information. This data
        should be relevant to the research objective and support analysis.

        3. **Stakeholders**: Identifying the stakeholders involved in data collection
        and decision-making is critical. This includes individuals or organizations
        that have a vested interest in the research findings.

        4. **Relevant Data**: Selecting data that is relevant to the research question
        and objective is essential. This involves identifying the most critical variables
        and indicators that will support analysis.

        5. **Methodology**: Case studies involve a structured approach, including
        data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This may involve multiple methods,
        such as interviews, observations, and document analysis.


        **Use Cases of Case Studies:**


        1. **Exploratory Research**: Case studies are often used to explore a new
        topic or research question. This involves collecting data and analyzing it
        to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.

        2. **In-Depth Analysis**: Case studies provide a comprehensive and in-depth
        analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. This involves collecting
        and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

        3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
        This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
        that support or challenge existing theory.

        4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices
        or successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

        5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
        of a particular program, policy, or intervention.


        **Conclusion**


        Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth
        and comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
        the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and
        conduct effective studies that support their research objectives.


        **Recommendations**


        1. Clearly define the research objective and scope of the case study.

        2. Identify the relevant stakeholders and data requirements.

        3. Select data that is relevant to the research question and objective.

        4. Use a structured approach to data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the case study methodology and adjust as
        needed.

      task: Run workflow
      llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the button "Run
        workflow" might not be visible in Microsoft Teams, and instead, you can manually
        run a workflow using specific commands or tools. Here are the steps to run
        a workflow based on the search results:


        **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions**


        1. If you have created a workflow on a non-default branch (e.g., a feature
        branch), you can use the `--ref` flag to run the workflow on that branch.
        For example:

        ```

        gh workflow run --ref <branch-name> <workflow-name>

        ```

        Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to run the workflow
        on, and `<workflow-name>` with the name of the workflow you want to run.


        2. If you want to list valid workflow names, use the `gh workflow` command
        with the `list` option:

        ```

        gh workflow list

        ```

        **Option 2: Using GitHub CLI**


        1. To run a workflow, use the `workflow run` subcommand. Replace `<workflow-parameter>`
        with the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to run:

        ```

        gh workflow run <workflow-parameter>

        ```

        **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface**


        1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you
        created the workflow.

        2. Click on the "Actions" tab.

        3. Find the workflow you want to run and click on the three dots next to it.

        4. Select "Run workflow" from the dropdown menu.


        **Option 4: Using Power Apps or Power Automate**


        1. If you created the workflow using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow),
        you can run it from within Power Apps or Power Automate.

        2. Open Power Apps or Power Automate and navigate to the workflow you want
        to run.

        3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the workflow.


        **Additional Tips**


        * Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the workflow.

        * Check the security constraints defined by your organization to ensure you
        can complete the steps.

        * For troubleshooting information, see the GitHub Docs or the Microsoft documentation
        for Power Apps and Power Automate.'

        and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

        3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
        This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
        that support or challenge existing theory.

        4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices
        or successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

        5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
        of a particular program, policy, or intervention.


        **Conclusion**


        Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth
        and comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
        the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and

      llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the button "Run
        workflow" might not be visible in Microsoft Teams, and instead, you can manually
        run a workflow using specific commands or tools. Here are the steps to run
        a workflow based on the search results:


        **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions**


        1. If you have created a workflow on a non-default branch (e.g., a feature
        branch), you can use the `--ref` flag to run the workflow on that branch.
        For example:

        ```

        gh workflow run --ref <branch-name> <workflow-name>

        ```

        Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to run the workflow
        on, and `<workflow-name>` with the name of the workflow you want to run.


        2. If you want to list valid workflow names, use the `gh workflow` command
        with the `list` option:

        ```

        gh workflow list

        ```

        **Option 2: Using GitHub CLI**


        1. To run a workflow, use the `workflow run` subcommand. Replace `<workflow-parameter>`
        with the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to run:

        ```

        gh workflow run <workflow-parameter>

        ```

        **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface**


        1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you
        created the workflow.

        2. Click on the "Actions" tab.

        3. Find the workflow you want to run and click on the three dots next to it.

        4. Select "Run workflow" from the dropdown menu.


        **Option 4: Using Power Apps or Power Automate**


        1. If you created the workflow using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow),
        you can run it from within Power Apps or Power Automate.

        2. Open Power Apps or Power Automate and navigate to the workflow you want
        to run.

        3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the workflow.


        **Additional Tips**


        * Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the workflow.

        * Check the security constraints defined by your organization to ensure you
        can complete the steps.

        * For troubleshooting information, see the GitHub Docs or the Microsoft documentation
        for Power Apps and Power Automate.'

              \ use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn\u2019t require\
              \ any user interaction. How do I run a workflow? To see the Run workflow\
              \ button, your workflow file must use the workflow_dispatch event trigger.\
              \ Only workflow files that use the workflow_dispatch event trigger will\

              \ Branch? You can run a workflow that is still in development in a branch\
              \ branch-name from the command line, with the GitHub CLI. The documentation\
              \ says: To run a workflow on a branch other than the repository's default\
              \ branch, use the --ref flag . To list valid workflow names, use gh\
              \ workflow list. To add input parameters, run it like this: Does workflow_dispatch\
              \ work if a workflow has been run once? Specifically for workflow_dispatch\
              \ this won't work until the workflow has run once before. You can add\
              \ a push event hook and then it will be activated after running once.\

        analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. This involves collecting
        and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

        3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
        This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
        that support or challenge existing theory.

        4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices
        or successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

        5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
        of a particular program, policy, or intervention.


        **Conclusion**


        Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth
        and comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
        the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and

      llm_response: 'Based on the web search results, it appears that the button "Run
        workflow" might not be visible in Microsoft Teams, and instead, you can manually
        run a workflow using specific commands or tools. Here are the steps to run
        a workflow based on the search results:


        **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions**


        1. If you have created a workflow on a non-default branch (e.g., a feature
        branch), you can use the `--ref` flag to run the workflow on that branch.
        For example:

        ```

        gh workflow run --ref <branch-name> <workflow-name>

        ```

        Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to run the workflow
        on, and `<workflow-name>` with the name of the workflow you want to run.


        2. If you want to list valid workflow names, use the `gh workflow` command
        with the `list` option:

        ```

        gh workflow list

        ```

        **Option 2: Using GitHub CLI**


        1. To run a workflow, use the `workflow run` subcommand. Replace `<workflow-parameter>`
        with the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to run:

        ```

        gh workflow run <workflow-parameter>

        ```

        **Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface**


        1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository where you
        created the workflow.

        2. Click on the "Actions" tab.

        3. Find the workflow you want to run and click on the three dots next to it.

        4. Select "Run workflow" from the dropdown menu.


        **Option 4: Using Power Apps or Power Automate**


        1. If you created the workflow using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow),
        you can run it from within Power Apps or Power Automate.

        2. Open Power Apps or Power Automate and navigate to the workflow you want
        to run.

        3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the workflow.


        **Additional Tips**


        * Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the workflow.

        * Check the security constraints defined by your organization to ensure you
        can complete the steps.

        * For troubleshooting information, see the GitHub Docs or the Microsoft documentation
        for Power Apps and Power Automate.'

              \ use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn\u2019t require\
              \ any user interaction. How do I run a workflow? To see the Run workflow\
              \ button, your workflow file must use the workflow_dispatch event trigger.\
              \ Only workflow files that use the workflow_dispatch event trigger will\

              \ Your workflow will run automatically . An \"automatic\" requires no\
              \ further action from you once you've added it. Each workflow has a\
              \ trigger, and when the trigger occurs, an action or series of actions\
              \ happen automatically. Here are two examples: A Planner task on a board\
              \ (specified when you set up the workflow) changes status. Why do people\

              \ workflows. Real-time workflows. How do I run a workflow on a Github\
              \ Branch? You can run a workflow that is still in development in a branch\
              \ branch-name from the command line, with the GitHub CLI. The documentation\
              \ says: To run a workflow on a branch other than the repository's default\
              \ branch, use the --ref flag . To list valid workflow names, use gh\
              \ workflow list. To add input parameters, run it like this: Does workflow_dispatch\
              \ work if a workflow has been run once? Specifically for workflow_dispatch\
              \ this won't work until the workflow has run once before. You can add\
              \ a push event hook and then it will be activated after running once.\
              \ Using gh workflow list you can see the job in the list once it has\
              \ run once. Hmm I didn't know that gh exists. Thanks. Sadly as @Dustin\

              \ on a branch other than the repository's default branch, use the --ref\
              \ flag . To view the progress of the workflow run, use the run watch\
              \ subcommand and select the run from the interactive list. When using\
              \ the REST API, you configure the inputs and ref as request body parameters.\

      task: Based on the research findings, analyze the key features and use cases
      llm_response: '**Research Agent''s Analysis**


        Based on the web search results, I have identified the key features and use
        cases of case studies, which are a crucial component of research methodology.


        **Key Features of Case Studies:**


        1. **Clear Objective**: A well-defined research question or objective is essential
        for conducting a case study. This objective should be specific, measurable,
        achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

        2. **Data Requirements**: Case studies require a comprehensive collection
        of data, including both qualitative and quantitative information. This data
        should be relevant to the research objective and support analysis.

        3. **Stakeholders**: Identifying the stakeholders involved in data collection
        and decision-making is critical. This includes individuals or organizations
        that have a vested interest in the research findings.

        4. **Relevant Data**: Selecting data that is relevant to the research question
        and objective is essential. This involves identifying the most critical variables
        and indicators that will support analysis.

        5. **Methodology**: Case studies involve a structured approach, including
        data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This may involve multiple methods,
        such as interviews, observations, and document analysis.


        **Use Cases of Case Studies:**


        1. **Exploratory Research**: Case studies are often used to explore a new
        topic or research question. This involves collecting data and analyzing it
        to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.

        2. **In-Depth Analysis**: Case studies provide a comprehensive and in-depth
        analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. This involves collecting
        and analyzing data to identify key features and patterns.

        3. **Theory Development**: Case studies can be used to develop or test theory.
        This involves collecting data and analyzing it to identify patterns and relationships
        that support or challenge existing theory.

        4. **Best Practices**: Case studies can be used to identify best practices
        or successful strategies in a particular field or industry.

        5. **Evaluation**: Case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
        of a particular program, policy, or intervention.


        **Conclusion**


        Case studies are a valuable research methodology that can provide in-depth
        and comprehensive analysis of a specific phenomenon or organization. By identifying
        the key features and use cases of case studies, researchers can design and
        conduct effective studies that support their research objectives.


        **Recommendations**


        1. Clearly define the research objective and scope of the case study.

        2. Identify the relevant stakeholders and data requirements.

        3. Select data that is relevant to the research question and objective.

        4. Use a structured approach to data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the case study methodology and adjust as
        needed.
