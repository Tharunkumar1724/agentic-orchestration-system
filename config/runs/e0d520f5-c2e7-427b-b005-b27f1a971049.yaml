              Abstract: Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former
                captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed
                batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler. He currently represents
                Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket.
                Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-format batters
                of all time. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries
                in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international
                centuries scored, and is highest run-scorer in the IPL. Kohli was
                a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013
                ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions Trophy.
                Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship Mace
                between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three occasions.
                In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen.
                In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.

              Abstract: Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former
                captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed
                batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler. He currently represents
                Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket.
                Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-format batters
                of all time. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries
                in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international
                centuries scored, and is highest run-scorer in the IPL. Kohli was
                a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013
                ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions Trophy.
                Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship Mace
                between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three occasions.
                In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen.
                In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.

                  2013 ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions
                  Trophy. Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship
                  Mace between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three
                  occasions. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems like we''ve taken a significant detour from the original
          task of fetching stock price data and analyzing trends for prediction.


          Based on the previous communication, it appears that the conversation has
          shifted to searching for information about "VIRAT KOHLI". However, there
          is no relevance to stock price data or analysis.


          To get back on track, I''ll need to clarify that the original task was to
          fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction. If you''d like
          to continue with the original task, please provide me with a new search
          term or clarification regarding the stock ticker symbol.


          If you''d like to continue with the information about "VIRAT KOHLI", I can
          try to provide more information about the topic, but it will not be relevant
          to the original task.


          Please let me know how to proceed.'

                  2013 ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions
                  Trophy. Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship
                  Mace between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three
                  occasions. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems like we''ve taken a significant detour from the original
          task of fetching stock price data and analyzing trends for prediction.


          Based on the previous communication, it appears that the conversation has
          shifted to searching for information about "VIRAT KOHLI". However, there
          is no relevance to stock price data or analysis.


          To get back on track, I''ll need to clarify that the original task was to
          fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction. If you''d like
          to continue with the original task, please provide me with a new search
          term or clarification regarding the stock ticker symbol.


          If you''d like to continue with the information about "VIRAT KOHLI", I can
          try to provide more information about the topic, but it will not be relevant
          to the original task.


          Please let me know how to proceed.'

                  2013 ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions
                  Trophy. Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship
                  Mace between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three
                  occasions. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems like we''ve taken a significant detour from the original
          task of fetching stock price data and analyzing trends for prediction.


          Based on the previous communication, it appears that the conversation has
          shifted to searching for information about "VIRAT KOHLI". However, there
          is no relevance to stock price data or analysis.


          To get back on track, I''ll need to clarify that the original task was to
          fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction. If you''d like
          to continue with the original task, please provide me with a new search
          term or clarification regarding the stock ticker symbol.


          If you''d like to continue with the information about "VIRAT KOHLI", I can
          try to provide more information about the topic, but it will not be relevant
          to the original task.


          Please let me know how to proceed.'

                  in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international
                  centuries scored, and is highest run-scorer in the IPL. Kohli was
                  a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup,
                  2013 ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions
                  Trophy. Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship
                  Mace between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three
                  occasions. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems like we''ve taken a significant detour from the original
          task of fetching stock price data and analyzing trends for prediction.


          Based on the previous communication, it appears that the conversation has
          shifted to searching for information about "VIRAT KOHLI". However, there
          is no relevance to stock price data or analysis.


          To get back on track, I''ll need to clarify that the original task was to
          fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction. If you''d like
          to continue with the original task, please provide me with a new search
          term or clarification regarding the stock ticker symbol.


          If you''d like to continue with the information about "VIRAT KOHLI", I can
          try to provide more information about the topic, but it will not be relevant
          to the original task.


          Please let me know how to proceed.'

                  in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international
                  centuries scored, and is highest run-scorer in the IPL. Kohli was
                  a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup,
                  2013 ICC Champions Trophy, 2024 T20 World Cup and 2025 Champions
                  Trophy. Under his captaincy India held the ICC World Test Championship
                  Mace between 2016 and 2020, winning the end of season prize on three
                  occasions. In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems like we''ve taken a significant detour from the original
          task of fetching stock price data and analyzing trends for prediction.


          Based on the previous communication, it appears that the conversation has
          shifted to searching for information about "VIRAT KOHLI". However, there
          is no relevance to stock price data or analysis.


          To get back on track, I''ll need to clarify that the original task was to
          fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction. If you''d like
          to continue with the original task, please provide me with a new search
          term or clarification regarding the stock ticker symbol.


          If you''d like to continue with the information about "VIRAT KOHLI", I can
          try to provide more information about the topic, but it will not be relevant
          to the original task.


          Please let me know how to proceed.'
