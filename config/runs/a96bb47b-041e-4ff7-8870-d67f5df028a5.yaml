        3. Other subsidiaries or associated companies


        If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for prediction.
        However, please note that stock price data may be available on certain exchanges
        or platforms but not on others. I''ll do my best to find the most up-to-date
        and reliable information.

          To move forward, I''ll attempt to find the stock price data for Reliance
          Retail or its associated companies. This might include:


          1. Reliance Industries (RIL: NSE, 500325: BSE)

          2. Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL: NSE, 531371: BSE)

          3. Other subsidiaries or associated companies


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that stock price data may be available
          on certain exchanges or platforms but not on others. I''ll do my best to
          find the most up-to-date and reliable information.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Reliance Retail or its associated companies.'

          To move forward, I''ll attempt to find the stock price data for Reliance
          Retail or its associated companies. This might include:


          1. Reliance Industries (RIL: NSE, 500325: BSE)

          2. Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL: NSE, 531371: BSE)

          3. Other subsidiaries or associated companies


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that stock price data may be available
          on certain exchanges or platforms but not on others. I''ll do my best to
          find the most up-to-date and reliable information.
