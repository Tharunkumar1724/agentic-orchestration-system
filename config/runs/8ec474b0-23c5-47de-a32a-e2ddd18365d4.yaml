          **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**


          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems
          to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence.
          This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.
          AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance
          and adapt to new situations. AI has a wide range of applications, including
          natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems.

          **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**


          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems
          to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence.
          This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.
          AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance
          and adapt to new situations. AI has a wide range of applications, including
          natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems.

          **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**


          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems
          to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence.
          This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.
          AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance
          and adapt to new situations. AI has a wide range of applications, including
          natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems.

          **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**


          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems
          to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence.
          This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.
          AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance
          and adapt to new situations. AI has a wide range of applications, including
          natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems.


          **5 AI Apps That Actually Work**


          According to a Medium article, here are 5 cool iPad apps that utilize AI:


          1. **Prism**: An AI-powered photo editor that uses machine learning to analyze
          and enhance images.

          2. **AIVA**: An AI-driven music composition app that creates original music
          based on user input.

          **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**


          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems
          to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence.
          This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.
          AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance
          and adapt to new situations. AI has a wide range of applications, including
          natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems.


          **5 AI Apps That Actually Work**


          According to a Medium article, here are 5 cool iPad apps that utilize AI:


          1. **Prism**: An AI-powered photo editor that uses machine learning to analyze
          and enhance images.

          2. **AIVA**: An AI-driven music composition app that creates original music
          based on user input.
