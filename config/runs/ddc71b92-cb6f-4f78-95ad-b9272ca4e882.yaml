      OpenAI aims to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is highly autonomous
      and capable of outperforming humans at most economically valuable work. The
      company believes that AGI has the potential to greatly benefit society, but
      also poses risks if not developed and used responsibly.


      **Research Areas**


      OpenAI is actively researching and developing various areas of artificial intelligence,
      including:


      1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: OpenAI is working on improving NLP

      search on OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. However, it appears
      that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


      Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
      available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies that
      are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


      1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its stock
      price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

      2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA (NVDA:
      NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


      If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for prediction.
      However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might be limited due
      to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock price.

        search on OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. However, it appears
        that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


        Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
        available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies that
        are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


        1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
        stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

        2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
        (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


        If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for prediction.
        However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might be limited
        due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock price.


        Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
        data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

          1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
          stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

          2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
          (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might
          be limited due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock
          price.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

          search on OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. However, it
          appears that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


          Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
          available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies
          that are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


          1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
          stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

          2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
          (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might
          be limited due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock
          price.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

        llm_response: 'It seems that the previous agent was trying to conduct a comprehensive
          search on OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. However, it
          appears that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


          Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
          available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies
          that are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


          1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
          stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

          2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
          (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might
          be limited due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock
          price.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'

          has a mission to develop "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence.


          **Mission and Goals**


          OpenAI aims to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is highly
          autonomous and capable of outperforming humans at most economically valuable
          work. The company believes that AGI has the potential to greatly benefit
          society, but also poses risks if not developed and used responsibly.


          **Research Areas**


          OpenAI is actively researching and developing various areas of artificial

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

          appears that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


          Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
          available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies
          that are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


          1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
          stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

          2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
          (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might
          be limited due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock
          price.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'

                for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of
                text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora. Its release
                of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread
                interest in generative AI. The organization has a complex corporate
                structure. As of October 2025, it is led by the non-profit OpenAI
                Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered in Delaware, which holds
                a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC, a for-profit public benefit
                corporation which commercializes its products. Microsoft invested
                over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides Azure cloud computing resources.","AbstractURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI","Answer":"","AnswerType":"","Definition":"","DefinitionSource":"","DefinitionURL":"","Entity":"company","Heading":"OpenAI","Image":"/i/fb410946942ab334.png","ImageHeight":270,"ImageIsLogo":1,"ImageWidth":1004,"Infobox":{"content":[{"data_type":"string","label":"Type","sort_order":"1000","value":"Private","wiki_order":0},{"data_type":"string","label":"Industry","sort_order":"1001","value":"Artificial

                Abstract: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence organization
                  headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop "safe
                  and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
                  as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically
                  valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,
                  OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the
                  DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model
                  named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited
                  with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI. The organization
                  has a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, it is led
                  by the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, founded in 2015 and registered
                  in Delaware, which holds a 26% equity stake in OpenAI Group PBC,
                  a for-profit public benefit corporation which commercializes its
                  products. Microsoft invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides
                  Azure cloud computing resources.

        task: Fetch stock price data and analyze trends for prediction
        llm_response: 'It seems that the previous agent was trying to conduct a comprehensive
          search on OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company. However, it
          appears that we were unable to find any relevant stock price data for prediction.


          Since OpenAI is a private company, its stock price data might not be publicly
          available. However, I can try to find the stock price data for companies
          that are closely related to OpenAI, such as:


          1. Microsoft (MSFT: NASDAQ) - OpenAI is a subsidiary of Microsoft, and its
          stock price might be influenced by Microsoft''s performance.

          2. Other AI-related companies, such as Alphabet (GOOGL: NASDAQ) or NVIDIA
          (NVDA: NASDAQ), which might be impacted by the AI trend.


          If I''m able to find the stock price data, I''ll analyze the trends for
          prediction. However, please note that the accuracy of the prediction might
          be limited due to the lack of publicly available data on OpenAI''s stock
          price.


          Please let me know if you''d like me to proceed with finding the stock price
          data for Microsoft or other AI-related companies.'
