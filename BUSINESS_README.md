## 📌 Business Value Proposition

**Cut operational costs by up to 99% while processing 30-60x faster.**

This platform delivers **production-ready AI solutions** for 4 major industries, featuring a unique **dual-intelligence architecture** that lets you choose between:

- 🧠 **Normal Mode** - Premium quality with LLM reasoning ($0.05-$0.12/operation)
- ⚡ **Research Mode** - Lightning-fast pattern matching ($0.00/operation)

### Why This Matters

Traditional automation is either **expensive** (LLM-powered) or **inflexible** (rule-based). We offer **both**, letting you optimize cost and quality for each use case.
